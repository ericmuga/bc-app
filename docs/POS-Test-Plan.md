# POS Module — Test Plan

**System:** BC POS Application (Vue 3 client + Express/Node API + SQL Server, integrated with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central)
**Audience:** Business Analysts, QA Analysts, Operations
**Purpose:** End-to-end UAT script for the POS module. Each test case is independently executable and has clear pass/fail criteria.

---

## How to use this document

1. Pre-load the **Test Environment** (Section 1) and create the **Test Users** (Section 2).
2. Run the test cases in order; later sections depend on earlier ones (e.g. you can't sell items if the catalogue hasn't been synced).
3. Record **Actual Result** + **Pass/Fail** + **Defect ID** in each row. The sign-off table at the end summarises run status.
4. Critical failures (marked **CRITICAL**) block release; majors warrant ticket + retest; minors are logged.

Severity legend: **C** = Critical · **H** = High · **M** = Medium · **L** = Low.

## 1. Test Environment

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| API base URL | `http://<test-host>:3000/api` |
| Web client | `http://<test-host>:5173` (dev) or built artifact behind nginx |
| SQL Server (App DB) | `dbo.PosShop`, `PosItem`, `PosOrder`, `PosTillSession`, `PosUserShop`, etc. |
| BC SQL (read-only) | per-company schemas: `FCL$`, `CM$`, `RMK$`, `FLM$` |
| eTIMS sandbox | `ETIMS_BASE_URL` env on server |
| MPESA Daraja | sandbox keys in env (`DARAJA_*`) |
| Thermal printer | 72 mm receipt printer, default Windows print queue |

### Required pre-test data
- BC company `FCL` has at least 12 customers tagged with `Customer Price Group = 'FCL SHOPS'`, with assigned Salesperson Codes.
- BC company `CM` has the same outlets tagged with `Customer Posting Group = 'FCL SHOPS'`.
- BC items have `PDA Item = 1`, non-blank `E-Tims Item Code`, non-zero Sales Price, `Description <> 'Discontiued'`.
- A test SMTP relay (or MailHog) is reachable for coupon-email tests.

## SECTION A — Inventory Load Per Location (BC → POS sync)

**Pre-condition:** Logged in as `qa.admin`, BC connectivity confirmed.

| # | Test Case | Steps | Expected | Sev | Actual | Pass/Fail |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Sync — Shops (FCL, fresh) | Admin Setup → POS Setup → Sync from BC → company **FCL** → tick **Wipe** → Sync **Shops** | `PosShop` rows = count of FCL customers in `Customer Price Group = 'FCL SHOPS'` (~12); `FclCustomerNo` populated; `PosUserShop` cleared | C | | |
| A2 | Sync — Shops (CM, merge) | Same flow → company **CM** → leave wipe **off** → Sync **Shops** | Same `PosShop` row-count (12). Each row now has both `FclCustomerNo` and `CmCustomerNo` filled; merged by Name (case-insensitive trim) | C | | |
| A3 | Sync — Shops (other company, no rule) | Sync shops with company = `RMK` (no env override set) | Returns 0 BC rows; existing `PosShop` rows unchanged; server log: `no filter rule for company, skipping` | M | | |
| A4 | Sync — Categories (eTIMS-filtered) | Sync **Categories** for FCL | `PosCategory` populated only with Inventory Posting Groups that have at least one item where `PDA Item=1`, `EtimsItemCode<>''`, sales price `<>0`, Description `<> 'Discontiued'` | H | | |
| A5 | Sync — Items (FCL fresh) | Sync **Items** for FCL with **Wipe** ticked | `PosItem` cleared then refilled. Each row has `Code`, `Name`, `UnitPrice>0`, `BarCodeNo`, `EtimsItemCode`, `EtimsClassCode`, `VatPercent` (16 if VAT16, else 0), `SourceCompany='FCL'` | C | | |
| A6 | Sync — Items (CM, multi-company) | Sync **Items** for CM (no wipe) | New rows from CM appear with `SourceCompany='CM'`. FCL items unchanged. Items appearing in both companies appear as 2 rows with different `SourceCompany`. | H | | |
| A7 | Listing — items per shop | POS terminal: log in as `qa.cashier1` (assigned to shop X). Open POS. | Visible items = items active for shop X's `SourceCompany`. Out-of-stock items hidden if `HideOutOfStock` setting on. "Remaining" badge shown per card. | C | | |
| A8 | Listing — categories per shop | Same context | Categories listed contain at least one visible item. Empty categories hidden. | M | | |
| A9 | Stock at shop's location | Pick item, check Remaining; cross-check against BC inventory at the shop's `LocationCode` aggregated across BC item ledger | Remaining = `SUM(Quantity)` from BC `Item Ledger Entry` for `(Item No, Location Code)` | C | | |
| A10 | Stock fail-closed | Disconnect BC SQL temporarily, refresh POS terminal | Items load with **Remaining = N/A**, "Add to cart" disabled (don't allow guesses); error toast | H | | |
| A11 | Sync — Payment Types | Sync **Payment Types** for FCL | `PosPaymentType` populated. Composite uniqueness on `(Code, ShopCode)` with shop-scoped overrides allowed. No duplicate-key error if a code exists in both global and shop scope. | H | | |
| A12 | Sync — Walk-in customers | Sync **Walk-in Customers** for FCL | One walk-in `PosContact` per shop with `IsWalkIn=1`, linked to shop's `WalkInCustomerNo`, name + KraPin from BC | M | | |
| A13 | Sync — Contacts (sub-customers) | Sync **Contacts** for FCL | All BC contacts whose `Salesperson Code` matches a shop are imported; `RouteCode`, `KraPin`, `CustomerType` populated | M | | |
| A14 | Idempotency | Run any sync step twice in a row without wipe | Counts stable; no duplicate rows; `UpdatedAt` advances | H | | |
| A15 | Wipe-and-reimport — items | Run Items sync with **Wipe** twice | Both runs succeed; dependent rows in `PosItemShop`, `PosItemCategory` are cleared and rebuilt | H | | |

## SECTION B — User Creation & Access Control

**Pre-condition:** Logged in as `qa.admin`. Test users from §2 NOT yet created.

| # | Test Case | Steps | Expected | Sev | Actual | P/F |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Create local user | Admin Setup → Users → Add. Username `qa.cashier1`, role `shop`, password set. | 201; user appears in list. Local login works. | C | | |
| B2 | Create AD user (auto-provision) | Log in via AD as a real domain user (qa.test) | First login provisions `Users` row, role = `user` (or `admin` if in AD admin group). Subsequent edits to role survive re-login. | H | | |
| B3 | Role validation | Try to create user with role `superuser` | 400 — `role must be one of …` | M | | |
| B4 | Disable user | Admin Setup → Users → toggle IsActive off for `qa.cashier1` | Login fails: 401 `Invalid credentials` | C | | |
| B5 | Login — bad password | POST `/api/auth/login` username `qa.admin`, wrong password | 401 `Invalid credentials`. No timing leak (constant-ish response) | C | | |
| B6 | Login — AD on local endpoint | POST `/api/auth/login` for an AD-only user | 400 `This account uses Active Directory…` | M | | |
| B7 | JWT lifetime | Log in, decode token | `exp` ≈ now + `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (default 8h) | M | | |
| B8 | Route gate — admin-only | As `qa.cashier1`, GET `/api/pos/setup/items` | 403 | C | | |

| B11 | Default route — admin | Log in as `qa.admin`, land on `/` | Redirects to `/orders/scan` | M | | |
| B12 | Default route — shop-admin | Log in as `qa.shopadmin`, land on `/` | Redirects to `/pos` (router-local fallback handles POS roles) | C | | |
| B13 | Default route — finance | Log in as `qa.finance`, land on `/` | Redirects to `/finance` | M | | |
| B14 | Sidebar visibility — shop-admin | Inspect sidebar | Shows POS nav + Administration **POS-related items only** (no Users, SMTP, Schedules) | H | | |
| B15 | Cashier ↔ Shops assign | Admin Setup → Users → "Cashiers ↔ Shops" → assign `qa.cashier2` to shops S1 + S2; mark S1 primary | `PosUserShop` rows: 2; one with `IsPrimary=1`. Legacy `Users.ShopCode` mirrors S1. | H | | |
| B16 | Multi-shop login | Log in as `qa.cashier2` | Loads POS for primary shop S1 by default. Shop switcher (if implemented) lists S1 + S2. | H | | |
| B17 | Single-shop assign | `qa.cashier1` assigned to S1 only | Logs in directly to S1 with no switcher prompt | M | | |
| B18 | Audit — user create | Create user; check `AuditLog` | Row inserted: `userId`, `action='POST /api/auth/create-user'`, `request body` redacted of password | H | | |
| B19 | Password change (self) | If self-service exists | Old password verified; new password rehashed (bcrypt 12 rounds); audit row written | M | | |
| B20 | Password reset (admin) | Admin resets a user's password | New `PasswordHash` set; `AuthProvider='local'` if previously empty | M | | |
